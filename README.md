# Face-Detection-and-Recognition-Attendance-Script-With-Excel-Report
This is the third version of my OpenCV python program, I have combined scripts from my previous projects and made a single script that can allow users to train and recognize trained faces and automatic Roll Number marked excel sheet. 

- Edit this path with the png file, before running the program:
icon_image = Image.open(r"your logo/icon image path here")
